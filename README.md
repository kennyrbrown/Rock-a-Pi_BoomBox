# Rock-a-Pi_BoomBox
My mother-in-law wants to recreate for her grandchildren the tactile experience of choosing and playing one's own music. Before she could read she would play her own mini records and it was foundational to her love of music. I want to help her to make a 21st century version of this experience leveraging our world of streamable music and custom playlists.

The concept is a portable, standalone music player that reads RFID cards linked to a Spotify playlist. The user will place the card onto the device for the card to be read, and a Raspberry Pi loaded with Pi MusicBox. The device should't have any screens and should be so simple that a 3 year old could use it!
